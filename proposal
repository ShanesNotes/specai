# SpecAI Handshakes Proposal
## Overview
SpecAI optimizes nurse workflows and patient care, built in Rust with Rig (from ARC) and ARC on Solana. Inspired by @piotrostr’s Listen toolkit, it’s a "Healthcare Leatherman" with simulated healthcare expertise and chatbot modes.
## Goals
- Optimize workflows via first-principles (assess, treat, etc.).
- Securely log via ARC/Epic with SHA-256 and OAuth 2.0 (simulated, live TBD).
- Engage community with “SpecAI Handshakes,” leveraging Listen’s versatility (@piotrostr).
