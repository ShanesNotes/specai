# SpecAI Handshakes Proposal

## Overview
SpecAI optimizes nurse workflows and patient care, built in Rust with Rig (from ARC) and ARC on Solana. Inspired by @piotrostr’s Listen toolkit, it’s a "Healthcare Leatherman" with simulated healthcare expertise and chatbot modes.

## Goals
- Optimize workflows via first-principles (assess, treat, etc.).
- Securely log via ARC/Epic with SHA-256 and OAuth 2.0 (simulated, live TBD).
- Engage community with “SpecAI Handshakes,” leveraging Listen’s versatility (@piotrostr).

## Technical Details
- **Rust**: Performance/safety (Listen-inspired, @piotrostr).
- **Rig**: Modular AgentBuilder (https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig).
- **ARC**: Blockchain logging.
- **Epic**: Simulated FHIR API integration (OpenEMR-based).
- **Pipeline**: Task prioritization (Listen’s Trading Engine, @piotrostr).

## Demo
`cargo run -- release -- interact "How am I doing?" --voice`
